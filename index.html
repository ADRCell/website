        <h3 class="sushi__title">Saamrasya – The ADR Cell of Army Law College, Pune
</h3>
        <p class="sushi__description">At Army Law College, Pune, we believe that law is not just about litigation—it’s also about resolution, communication, and building bridges. That’s where Saamrasya, our Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) Cell, comes in.

Saamrasya, meaning harmony, is dedicated to promoting peaceful and effective methods of resolving disputes outside the courtroom. Whether it’s mediation, negotiation, arbitration, or client counselling, our Cell is a hub for learning, practicing, and mastering the art of alternative dispute resolution.

We often organize workshops, training sessions, guest lectures, and interactive events that give students hands-on experience and insights from professionals in the field. From client counselling competitions to simulation exercises, Saamrasya offers an engaging platform for students to develop crucial legal and interpersonal skills.

Whether you're curious about ADR or passionate about exploring law beyond litigation, Saamrasya is the place to start.
